        <h5 class="aboutTitle">About</h5>
        <p class="description">I am a 15-year-old Filipino student at Western Springs College. I watch movies, anime, and TV shows in my free time. The sports that I play are badminton, volleyball, and a bit of basketball. Digital technology has been a part of me for a few years now even before I started at Springs but during my study here in school, my passion for this subject has been different compared to before. The passion in me led me to being dedicated to this field. Seeing people who had their successes in this field has inspired me to be like them in the future.</p>
        
        <h6 class="aboutSubtitle">Portfolio</h6>
        <p class="aboutDescription">This portfolio will serve as an exhibition of different topics. It will feature the processes and steps that I have executed including the changes I have made in my design, code, and overall outcome. Projects that I will make in the next few terms will also be shown in the ‚ÄòProjects‚Äô section including a description on what is featured in that project.</p>
