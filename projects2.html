              <h1 class="projectTitle">Project 2: Python Coded Game</h1>
        <h3 class="title">Design Considerations</h3>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Overview</h5>
        <p>I will be coding a Python focused game. It is about words and basically like a Hangman program. It will be scrambled each round and you can play multiple times.</p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">End Users</h5>
        <p>The end user of this program would be people who likes words and english in general or people that want to expand their vocabulary in a fun way. The age group that this program would be appropriate for is for aged 6+.</p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Requirements</h5>
            <p>What should this include:</p>
            <ul>
                <p>A list of words</p>
                <p>Randomiser</p>
                <p>Different levels of words</p>
            </ul>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Specifications</h5>
            <p>A game that will showcase a whole list of words.</p>
            <p>It should be fast and won't cause any errors when the input is different.</p>
            <p>This would be a game that any user can play without any restrictions.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Relevant Implications</h3>
        <h6 class="subtitle">Aesthetics</h6>
        <p>To maintain the aesthetics of my character, I will continue to use the same colour pallete throughout this project and make sure that the aesthetics will also please my end-users. I would also ask feedback from my peers to gather information about improvement and what I could change to make the product look proper.</p>
        <h6 class="subtitle">Usability</h6>
        <p>I will be testing every now and then to check whether the changes that I have made with aesthetics as well as functionality has affected the usability of my character. By doing this step, I can avoid bigger problems as I can easily keep track of what part of the process has affected the usability of my character. I will also gather feedback from my peers and ask how their experience with my character, whether the quality of my character is okay and not experiencing problems.</p>
        <h6 class="subtitle">Functionality</h6>
        <p>To make sure that my character is functioning properly, I will ensure that the steps that I have made throughout this project will make my character function the way that my end-users want it to function. I will also make sure that my character functions properly and is not affecting any other factor outside functionality such as usability and aesthetics.</p>
        <h6 class="subtitle">Intellectual Property</h6>
        <p>This character is inspired by a character from the game 'Mobile Legends: Bang Bang' named 'Nana' who is a sweet Leonin. My character on the other hand is a human fox. By changing features such as colours, face shape, and overall aura, I would be able to make my character different from existing characters. I would also not allow people to copy my work as it is my right to have my work protected but people can use my character as an inspiration for theirs.</p>
