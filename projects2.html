        <h3 class="title">Design Considerations</h3>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Overview</h5>
        <p>I will be coding a Python focused game. It is about words and basically like a Hangman program. It will be scrambled each round and you can play multiple times.</p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">End Users</h5>
        <p>The end user of this program would be people who likes words and english in general or people that want to expand their vocabulary in a fun way. The age group that this program would be appropriate for is for aged 6+.</p>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Requirements</h5>
            <p>What should this include:</p>
            <ul>
                <p>A list of words</p>
                <p>Randomiser</p>
                <p>Different levels of words</p>
            </ul>
        <h5 class="subtitle">Specifications</h5>
            <p>A game that will showcase a whole list of words.</p>
            <p>It should be fast and won't cause any errors when the input is different.</p>
            <p>This would be a game that any user can play without any restrictions.</p>
    <br>
        <h3 class="title">Relevant Implications</h3>
        <h6 class="subtitle">Aesthetics</h6>
        <p>To maintain and make my code look good, I will be making sure to use indents as well as spaces in between code to help our code to be futureproofed. I will also make sure that the letters will be easy to read.</p>
        <h6 class="subtitle">Usability</h6>
        <p>I will be conducting multiple tests to ensure that the user will not be able to experience any errors and I will do this by letting my peers share their feedback regarding on this python programme.</p>
        <h6 class="subtitle">Functionality</h6>
        <p>To ensure that the programme works the way it should work, I will be making sure to remember the wants and needs of my end users which is to have a smooth operating prgramme that has the right level of difficulty.</p>
